# Note Photos

This is a small site that will eventually allow me to digitize my notebook pages.

Right now, it's under construction. The intended list of features is:

-   [x] Take photos, enter metadata and upload
-   [x] Display all photos on a single page
-   [x] Be able to edit a single photo's metadata
-   [x] Bulk image capture (use previous photo's date with a 'next day' and 'previous day' button)
-   [ ] Bulk metadata editor
-   [ ] Nicer photo display, grouped by month or category with tags filter (include or exclude)
-   [ ] Exposed API to link with WeekLog, Mountaineer, etc.
-   [x] Ensure internal delete API route also deletes files from FB storage
